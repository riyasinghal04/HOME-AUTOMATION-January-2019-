# HOME-AUTOMATION-January-2019-
In a time when we are all becoming more environmentally aware, home automation provides a good solution to help preserve our natural resources. Home automation products can reduce power consumption and automatically turn off lights and appliances when they aren't in use. In this project, I have implemented the home automation model via two methods: 1)Using IR sensors and PIR sensors . They were used in order to sense the presence of a person in the room. If no person is present in the room, lights will turn off automatically. 2)using UART communication in order to control the appliances via mobile bluetooth We designed a basic app to control the lights in a room using MIT App Inventor.
